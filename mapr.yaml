If the coalesce interval is at least 6 minutes, then                            only the first read operation is logged. However, if the interval is                            between 4 minutes, then only the first and third read operations are                            logged.

This value is ignored if autosplit is set to false . If autosplit is set to true , MapR-DB splits a                   region when the size of the region exceeds 150% of the average value. For example,                   if the average value is 4096 MB, MapR-DB splits a region that is larger than 6144                   MB. Although splits are automatic, merges are not. For example, if the value of regionsizemb is changed from 8 GB to 4 GB, all regions that are                   eligible are split automatically, if autosplit is set to true . However, if the value of regionsizemb is                   changed from 2 GB to 4 GB, regions smaller than 4 GB are not automatically                   merged.

For example, suppose you had a JSON table that contained documents with this                   general structure: {      "_id":"value",      "title" : "Name of movie",      "trailers" :           {                "theatrical" : "Link to .mp4 file",                "teaser" : "Link to .mp4 file"           }      "images":           {                "small" : "Link to .jpg file",                "large" : "Link to .jpg file"           } } Both                   trailers and images are separate column families named, say, cf1 and cf2 respectively (while title belongs to default column                   family).

If -insertionorder is set to false , the results are returned in this order: {      "images" :           {                "large" : "Link to .jpg file",                "small" : "Link to .jpg file"           },      "title" : "Name of movie",      "trailers" :           {                "teaser" : "Link to .mp4 file",                "theatrical" : "Link to .mp4 file"           } } The                   results are similar to the previous results.

      description: "License required: Enterprise Edition Permissions required: fc or restore on the volume When a mirror is started, the mirror volume is synchronized from a hidden internal snapshot so that the mirroring process is not affected by any concurrent changes to the source volume. The volume mirror start command does not wait for mirror completion, but returns immediately. The changes to the mirror volume occur atomically at the end of the mirroring process; deltas transmitted from the source volume do not appear until mirroring is complete. To provide rollback capability for the mirror volume, the mirroring process creates a snapshot of the mirror volume before starting the mirror, with the following naming format: <volume>.mirrorsnap.<date>.<time> . Normally, the mirroring operation transfers only deltas from the last successful mirror. Under certain conditions (mirroring a volume repaired by fsck , for example), the source and mirror volumes can become out of sync. In such cases, it is impossible to transfer deltas, because the state is not the same for both volumes. Use the -full option to force the mirroring operation to transfer all data to bring the volumes back in sync."
